# CollegeRanker-Task-1
This repository contains all of the code for each individual lesson and is broken into two sections. HTML and CSS. Each section contains a folder for each lesson that contains all the code for the project as of the end of that lesson.

The code in these projects is only meant as a reference and should not be directly copied. Instead you should be creating your own web site for your own favorite cricketer.
