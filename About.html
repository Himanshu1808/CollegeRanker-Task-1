            batsman. He led the team to three ICC titles (2007 ICC World Twenty20, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy). He has won several awards and accolades in his career. In Indian domestic cricket he played for Bihar and Jharkhand
            Cricket team. As of 2022, he is the captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League. He was captain when CSK won the 2010, 2011, 2018 and 2021 editions of IPL league. Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004 against Bangladesh
